# Test Datasets

A small dataset is included to validate example algorithms can be correctly run. Evaluation should be performed on complete datasets which we provide informaiton in [datasets](../datasets)

- DPH19_s111_ch3: is YARP format converted of a single DHP19 session that can be used to validate live streaming applications
- dhp19_eros: is some EROS representations from a single DHP19 session that can be used to evaluate MoveEnet operation
