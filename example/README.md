# Example application and test-cases

The following example modules are available to get an idea of how to use the core functionality in your own project. Many of the example modules are built upon [YARP](www.yarp.it) but have Dockerfiles to enable simple environment set-up.

*  OpenPose extracing 2D joint positions, example module using e2vid functionality to produce images from events
*  [GL-HPE](https://github.com/gianscarpe/event-based-monocular-hpe) extracing 2D joint positions from event-images, intregrated with live play-back functionality
*  movenet extracing 2D joint positions from Exponentially-reduced Ordinal Surfaces
*  event-based velocity estimation and simple integration > 100 Hz.
*  event-volume compensation using IMU input to remove motion blur from rotating cameras.
