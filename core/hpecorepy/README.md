# Python Library for Detection and Processing

Python functions for calling Human Pose Estimation algorithms and event-based representations for on-line inference of human pose.

* e2vid - converts event volumes to an intensity image 
* gl-hpe - performs lifting 3D events inference
* fang-hpe - state-of-the-art (our) hpe implemented in python

### Instructions

for example:

add hpe-core/core/hpecorepy to the `$PYTHONPATH` environment variable

in your python script

from hpecorepy import e2vid
