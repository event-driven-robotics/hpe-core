# Dataset Conversion

This folder contains scripts for reading, preprocessing and exporting HPE datasets to common formats to enable valid comparison of human pose estimation algorithms. As each dataset has a unique format, tailored scripts are required per-dataset. As a final step we use [BIMVEE](https://github.com/event-driven-robotics/bimvee) to export events to any common format. 

We currently support the folowing datasets
* [DHP19](dhp19/README.md)
* [H3.6M](h36m/README.md)
* [MPII](mpii/README.md)
