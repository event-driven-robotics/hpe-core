# Human Pose Estimation Core Library
A library of functions for human pose estimation with event-driven cameras

* Compile and link the [core-library](https://github.com/event-driven-robotics/hpe-core/tree/main/core) in your application to use the event-based human pose estimation functions including:
  *   joint detectors (neural network implementations including OpenPose)
  *   joint velocity estimation
  *   asynchronous pose fusion
* [Example applications](https://github.com/event-driven-robotics/hpe-core/tree/main/example) are available to show how to connect the HPE blocks
* [Evaluate](https://github.com/event-driven-robotics/hpe-core/tree/main/evaluation) your performance using the scripts in evaluation
* Scripts to convert datasets are also available. Please contribute to the ever-growing datasets for event-driven HPE! For curated datasets compatible with the example function see [hosted datasts](https://github.com/event-driven-robotics/hpe-core) TODO
