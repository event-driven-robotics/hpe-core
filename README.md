Please contribute your event-driven HPE application and datasets to enable comparisons!

### [Core (C++)](https://github.com/event-driven-robotics/hpe-core/tree/main/core)

Compile and link the core C++ library in your application to use the event-based human pose estimation functions including:
* joint detectors: OpenPose built upon greyscales formed from events
* joint velocity estimation @>500Hz
* asynchronous pose fusion of joint velocity and detection
* event representation methods to be compatible with convolutional neural networks.

### [PyCore](https://github.com/event-driven-robotics/hpe-core/tree/main/pycore)

Importable python libraries for joint detection
* event-based movenet: MoveEnet built on PyTorch

### [Examples](https://github.com/event-driven-robotics/hpe-core/tree/main/example)

Some example applications are available giving ideas on how to use the HPE-core libraries
- MoveEnet inference code in corresponding example [here](https://github.com/event-driven-robotics/hpe-core/tree/main/example/movenet)

### [Evaluation](https://github.com/event-driven-robotics/hpe-core/tree/main/evaluation)

Python scripts can be used to compare different detectors and velocity estimation combinations

### [Datasets and Conversion](https://github.com/event-driven-robotics/hpe-core/tree/main/datasets)

Scripts to convert datasets into common formats to easily facilitate valid comparisons, and consistency
