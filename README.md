### [Core (C++)](https://github.com/event-driven-robotics/hpe-core/tree/main/core)

Compile and link the core C++ library in your application to use the event-based human pose estimation functions including:
* joint detectors: OpenPose built upon greyscales formed from events
* joint velocity estimation @>500Hz
* asynchronous pose fusion of joint velocity and detection
* event representation methods to be compatible with convolutional neural networks.

### PyCore

Importable python libraries for joint detection
* event-based movenet: MoveEnet built on PyTorch

### [Examples](https://github.com/event-driven-robotics/hpe-core/tree/main/example)

Some example applications are available giving ideas on how to use the HPE-core libraries

### [Evaluation](https://github.com/event-driven-robotics/hpe-core/tree/main/evaluation)

Python scripts can be used to compare different detectors and velocity estimation combinations

### Datasets and Conversion

Scripts to convert datasets into common formats to easily facilitate valid comparisons
